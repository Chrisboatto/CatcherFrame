**Decision Tree**

A Decision Tree is a map showing different methods the machine takes to provide possible outcomes of a series of related choices. It weighs possible actions based the importance or affect on the attribute in question. Decision Trees typically start with one single node and then branches off through importance into possible outcomes ; much like a tree does with its leaves. 

Decision trees are one of the more simple models to create to predict outcomes but are the basis of the Random Forest model. If you are interested in learning about predicted models I'd recommend decision trees as the first one to learn through its simplicity and its power. Then move onto a more intricate and complex model such as a Random Forest.

Flip through the Model RMarkdown in this folder to see how I coded and ran the predictive model.
