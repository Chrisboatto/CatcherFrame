# The graph below shows the accuracy between amounts of trees based off the Gradient Boosting model created. 
# Using the gbm.perf() you can create the graph to show the accuracy
# This graph shows that around 400 trees the cross-validation error decreased and essentially flattens out. 
# Therefore within the model the amount of trees above 500 or so would have been suffice to accurately predict called strikes
