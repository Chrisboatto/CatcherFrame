**Gradient Boosting**

Gradient Boosting is a method of converting weak learners into strong learners. Each new tree is a fit on a modified version of the original data set. Gradient Boosting performs its model by identifying the shortcomings of the attributes within the loss function (y = ax+b+e where e is the error term.)  The loss function is a measure how well the coefficients are fitting within the data. 

Gradient Boosting is the primary version of the Extreme Gradient Boosting method which you can find within the Extreme Gradient Boosting folder within this project.

Flip through the Model RMarkdown in this folder to see how I coded and ran the predictive model.
