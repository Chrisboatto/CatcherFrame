**Neural Net**

Neural Network predictive models that are inspired by the biological neuron system. It is made by a large number of interconnected elements to process and solve problems much like a brain of a living being. Neural Network follows a non-linear path and process in parallel information throughout the nodes. 

**Neural Net Models consist of three layers:**

- **Input layers:** Layers that take inputs based on existing data
- **Hidden layers:** Layers that use backpropagation to optimise the weights of the input variables in order to improve the predictive power of the model
- **Output layers:** Output of predictions based on the data from the input and hidden layers

Much like a living being the model has the ability to learn through previous examples which is why you could add a specific amount of hidden layers to which the model would improve the process.



Flip through the Model RMarkdown in this folder to see how I coded and ran the predictive model.
